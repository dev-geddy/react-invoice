## [react-invoice](https://react-invoice-nu.vercel.app/)
I've built this app for in-browser quick invoice creation. You can start using it here: [https://react-invoice-nu.vercel.app/](https://react-invoice-nu.vercel.app/).

### Features

- Create invoice
- Manage multiple invoices (no limit on count is set in the code)
- Edit invoice branding
- Edit supplier/provider details
- Edit customer details
- Select customer details from previous customers to auto-fill
- Add, edit, remove invoice entries
- Edit invoice number and series
- Define currency
- Define VAT rate
- Lock invoice so you don't accidentally change it
- Print layout. You may print invoice to a PDF or send to a printer.
- Auto-generate invoice number based on existing invoices
- Auto pre-fill provider details from latest invoice
- Show/hide provider and customer forms
- All data is stored in your browser's memory (localStorage). All data is yours.

### Running on your computer
To run it on your machine you'll need [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to run this JS app (or simply [Node](https://nodejs.org/) v16).

Install relevant Node version by running `nvm install 16`. Once Node is installed run below commands within the project directory.

```
nvm use
yarn install
yarn start
```

Note: all information is stored in your Browser's LocalStorage. You may access that via Developer Tools / Application / LocalStorage.
This means no information is sent anywhere, just exists and is stored on your web browser. If you update your browser or clear all history / cache, you're likely to lose all stored invoices.

### Default config

Default configuration is stored in `.env` file. In order to define your default invoice values clone `.env` into `.env.local` and modify default config values accordingly.

### Deployment

If you'd like to deploy this app for yourself, you need only a simple http server (Apache, Nginx or similar). Run `yarn build` and copy `/build` directory contents to your hosting.
